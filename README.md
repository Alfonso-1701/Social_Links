## My process

Set up HTML, then fine tuned the mobile version. After mobile was ready, added active states and finished with a small media query for desktop sizing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Went through this project pretty easily. 

### Continued development

Looking to keep an even pace when approaching problems and work. Putting self appointed pressure to get it done "fast", doesn't help me get it done any faster. 


### Useful resources

Used no resources.
